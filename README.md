# Team-Crashtress-2-Mod
A repository where me and a few friends merge/create a chaos mod for tf2.

I have included .exe variants of the vpk packaging script for people who do not have python on their PC. These exe's are built with pyinstaller and should be completely safe, but I understand if you prefer the .py version for safety reasons. The EXE will only work if tf2 is installed in the default location.
